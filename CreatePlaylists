# This here script will take a directory full of directories of

#	album2
# /artist2
#	album1...
#
# and create a playlist file in each album directory.

# Run with bash CreatePlayList, after chmod crap.
# Make sure there are no other directories in this one
# except directories of artists!
# Like, watch out for that 'system volume information' nonesense!
